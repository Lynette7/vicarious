## About

**Around the World in Books** is a beautiful, interactive platform that helps readers diversify their reading by exploring literature from countries around the globe. Unlike traditional reading trackers, this app combines immersive 3D visualization, AI-powered recommendations, and practical tools to help you actually acquire and read books from diverse cultures.

Whether your 2026 resolution is to "read more diversely," "visit every continent through literature," or "discover authors from 50 different countries," this platform turns those goals into actionable, trackable journeys.

### Built for Hackathon: "Commit To Change"

**Category:** Personal Growth & Learning  
**Special Prize:** Best Use of Opik ($5,000)

This project leverages AI agents and observability tools to provide personalized reading recommendations and track reading progress systematically.
